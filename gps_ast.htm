<h1> Check GNSS astrometry </h1>

<p> <a href="gps_expl.htm"> Click here for an explanation of what this page
is and why it exists, </a> and for links to related tools. </p>

<p> Cut and paste astrometry in the
<a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/OpticalObs.html"> MPC's
80-column astrometric reporting format </a> and/or in <a href="#tips">
ADES </a> format (PSV and/or XML),  and click 'Process observations'.
The program will figure out which GNSS satellite(s) you observed and tell you
how far off you were in along-track seconds and cross-track arcseconds,  for
each observation.  (The object designations can be anything you like;
they'll be ignored.)   At the bottom,  you'll get averages and standard
deviations. </p>

on this site,  including <a href="gps_find.htm"> a tool to list GNSS satellites

<h2> <a name="tips"> Tips for high-precision timing </a> </h2>

<p> <i>Usually</i>,  you can just cut-and-paste astrometry into the above form,
click 'Process Observations',  and you'll get back data on how good your timing
was.  The precision of the times in the
<a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/OpticalObs.html">
MPC's optical observation format </a> is a millionth of a day,  or 86.4
milliseconds.  (<i>If</i> you specify the time to six places!  If you
only give five places -- which many people do -- the precision is a measly
0.864 seconds,  and the software will warn you about that.) </p>

<p> For most people, "microday" precision is good enough. <a href="#requirements">
(Click here for a discussion of what 'good enough' timing means.) </a>
But even that is not enough for everybody.  Somewhat to my surprise,  I've encountered
situations where people are testing timing down to the ten-millisecond level.
In some cases,  it's curiosity.  Others really have data so precise,  on
objects moving so quickly,  that the motion over 0.01 seconds would cause
a noticeable error. </p>

<p> If you're one of these people,  you'll have to go beyond the MPC's format. </p>

<p> There are two different ways to do so.  You can provide data in the new
<a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/ADES.html">
ADES format</a>,  in either XML or PSV format.  <a href="astromet.htm">
Click here for details on astrometric data formats accepted by this tool.</a>

<p> If you aren't ADES-ready yet,  you can just modify the date/time shown
in the MPC formatted record to include extra precision.
<a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/pluto/mpecs/navst43.htm"> Click here
for an example of extended-precision observations. </a>  Here's the first observation
in that example,  shown first in the way MPC would expect (to six decimal places
in the day) and then to nine places,  and finally in hour/minute/second form
to millisecond precision.  Note that because all the data has to fit in the
columns assigned for the date/time,  spaces and colons get squeezed out. </p>

<h2> <a name="requirements"> How good does your timing really have to be,  anyway? </a> </h2>

<p> The level of timing accuracy for which you strive depends
mostly on how good the positions from your astrometry are,  and
how fast the objects you move are. </p>

<p> If your astrometry is good to about half an arcsecond,  and you're
observing an object moving at 3" per second,  then having your timing
off by 1/6 of a second would contribute about the same amount of error
as your positional measurement does.  So you'd really like to have your
timing be at least that good.  (And if you're using the "traditional"
80-column MPC format,  you should specify the time to six decimal places.) </p>

<p> The reality is that timing is often not all that hugely important.
Most objects are slow-movers.  If you're only observing main-belt or
more distant objects,  you can have significant timing errors and not
notice them.   The problem is that when you <i>do</i>
encounter a fast-moving NEO,  the timing becomes <i>very</i> important. </p>

<p> There's another subtle aspect of timing errors that deserves mention :
they tend to be systematic.  In the above instance,  if your timing is
1/6 second late on your first observation of the evening,  it'll probably
be about that late for subsequent observations as well.  Instead of
cancelling out as you get more data,  as random observational errors
ought to,  your errors will remain undiminished. </p>

<p> My recommended procedure would be to observe some GNSS satellites,
and then feed the astrometry through this page.  If it tells you that
your timing is off by,  say,  1.4 +/- 0.3 seconds,  do some analysis
to see why that's happening.  (Maybe you aren't actually synching to
NTP?  Maybe there's a software issue?  Etc.) </p>

<p> If that error seems entirely reasonable to you,  and repeats
consistently,  then adjust all your observational timings by 1.4 seconds.
And then,  if you can submit your data in the
<a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/ADES.html"> ADES
format </a> (which most software now can),  make sure that the
<tt>rmsTime</tt> field in your submissions is 0.3 seconds. </p>

<p> Properly written orbit determination software will make use
of <tt>rmsTime</tt>.  Us orbit guys are fine with the fact that your
timing isn't perfect.  But we really need to know just <i>how</i>
imperfect it is.  A timing error of 0.1 seconds might be perfectly
reasonable (if you didn't expect to do better than about +/- 0.3
seconds anyway).  Or it could flag a bad observation,  if you
really expected to be good to +/- 0.01 second (some video observations
are good to that level).  But those of us computing orbits from your
data do want that <tt>rmsTime</tt> information.  (We currently almost
never get it.) </p>
