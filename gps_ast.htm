<h1> Check GNSS astrometry </h1>

<p> <a href="gps_expl.htm"> Click here for an explanation of what this page
is and why it exists. </a> </p>

<p> Cut and paste astrometry in the
<a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/OpticalObs.html"> MPC's
80-column MPC format </a> (ADES to follow),  and click 'Process observations'.
The program will figure out which GNSS satellite(s) you observed and tell you
how far off you were in along-track seconds and cross-track arcseconds,  for
each observation.  (The object designations can be anything you like;
they'll be ignored.)   At the bottom,  you'll get averages and standard
deviations. </p>

If you're a human instead of a spambot,  you can probably figure out
how to remove the diacritical marks... </p>
