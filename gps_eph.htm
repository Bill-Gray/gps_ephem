<p> <a href="https://projectpluto.com/update8d.htm#time_entry"> Click here for a full list of possible
time formats that can be used. </a>  Feel free to experiment,  but getting
<i>too</i> clever is not advised.  I recommend a four-digit year,  named month,
and day followed by HH:MM:SS or decimal days (the first two examples shown
above),  leaving no ambiguity in your input. </p>

<p> <b> Time span: </b> Ephemerides are available from 1992 June 20 to four or
five days from now.  <i>Note</i> that unfortunately,  ephemerides for Galileo,
QZSS,  and BeiDou only run up to about a day ago;  from that point on,  all
we've got are ephems for GPS and GLONASS.  I'm working on this. </p>

<p> <b> Satellite IDs </b> with 'G' followed by two digits are GPS satellites.  Those
with 'R' followed by two digits are (Russian) GLONASS satellites.  'E'
is for the (European) Galileo satellites,  'J' for the (Japanese) QZSS,
and 'C' the (Chinese) BeiDou satellites. </p>

<p> <a name="mpc_code"> <b> MPC observatory code: </b> </a> This should be a
three-character code from
<a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/ObsCodesF.html">
the MPC's list of observatory codes. </a>  If you don't have such a code,
send me your latitude,  longitude,  and altitude (see contact details at
bottom) and I'll add a code for you. </p>

<p> <b> Satellite magnitudes</b>:  Jaime Nomen told me the magnitudes for GPS
satellites range from 10 to 14,  depending in part on the phase angle.  (I'm
hoping the GLONASS satellites are brighter,  but haven't heard of any
observations yet.)  By default,  the satellites are ordered by elongation;
I'd suggest getting satellites with high elongation that aren't marked 'Sha'
(in the earth's shadow).

<p> Jaime recommends getting images of multiple satellites at multiple times,
 to help detect random timing errors.

<p> <b> Accuracy</b> appears to be about an arcsecond,  which corresponds to
about 40 milliseconds of motion.  I should be able to improve this.  The satellites
have positions known to within a few centimeters.  Of course,  that's the position
of the antenna;  if the center of light measured on a CCD is,  say,  a meter
away,  that would lead about half a millisecond of error (the satellites move at
about 2000 meters a second).  I'm not sure why we aren't at something close to that
level of accuracy already. </p>

<p> <b> Source code</b>,  of a somewhat rough nature at this point,  is
now <a href="https://github.com/Bill-Gray/gps_ephem"> available at GitHub. </a>

<p> <a name="gnss"> <b> 'GNSS' </b> (Global Navigation Satellite System)
includes GPS,  GLONASS,  Galileo,
QZSS,  and BeiDou satellites.  You can get positions for GPS and GLONASS
for dates starting about a day ago and running a few days into the future (i.e.,
predictions are available).  For Galileo,  QZSS,  and BeiDou,  this is
sadly not the case.  You'll get data for them,  but only a day or so "late". </p>

<p> I realize that makes them nearly useless for testing your timing;
obviously,  you need some advance notice as to which direction to
point your telescope.  I'm working on this... I've inquiries into
various places as to where predictive ephems for all satellite systems
might be found.  If worst comes to worst,  I'll take the "day old" ephems
and integrate them ahead to the desired times.  But I'd really rather not
do that. </p>

<h2> <a name="ack"> Acknowledgments </a> </h2>

<p> My thanks go to Jaime Nomen and Noelia S&aacute;nchez Ortiz for their
thoughts on using navigation satellites for timing astrometry,  and for
providing <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/pluto/mpecs/navst43.htm">
some example astrometry for testing that I was getting the right answers.

If you're a human instead of a spambot,  you can probably figure out
how to remove the diacritical marks... </p>
