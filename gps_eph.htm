<p> <a href="https://projectpluto.com/update8d.htm#time_entry"> Click here for a full list of possible
time formats that can be used. </a>  Feel free to experiment,  but getting
<i>too</i> clever is not advised.  I recommend a four-digit year,  named month,
and day followed by HH:MM:SS or decimal days (the first two examples shown
above),  leaving no ambiguity in your input. </p>

<p> <b> Time span: </b> Ephemerides are available from 1992 June 20 to four or
five days from now.  <i>Note</i> that unfortunately,  ephemerides for Galileo,
QZSS,  and BeiDou only run up to about a day ago;  from that point on,  all
we've got are ephems for GPS and GLONASS.  I'm working on this. </p>

<p> <b> Satellite IDs </b> with 'G' followed by two digits are GPS satellites.  Those
with 'R' followed by two digits are (Russian) GLONASS satellites.  'E'
is for the (European) Galileo satellites,  'J' for the (Japanese) QZSS,
and 'C' the (Chinese) BeiDou satellites. </p>

<p> <a name="mpc_code"> <b> MPC observatory code: </b> </a> This should be a
three-character code from
<a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/ObsCodesF.html">
the MPC's list of observatory codes. </a>  If you don't have such a code,
send me your latitude,  longitude,  and altitude (see contact details at
bottom) and I'll add a code for you. </p>

<p> <b> Satellite magnitudes</b>:  Jaime Nomen told me the magnitudes for GPS
satellites range from 10 to 14,  depending in part on the phase angle.  (I'm
hoping the GLONASS satellites are brighter,  but haven't heard of any
observations yet.)  By default,  the satellites are ordered by elongation;
I'd suggest getting satellites with high elongation that aren't marked 'Sha'
(in the earth's shadow).

<p> Jaime recommends getting images of multiple satellites at multiple times,
 to help detect random timing errors.

<p> <b> Accuracy</b> appears to be at least down to 0.2 arcsecond,  or about
10 milliseconds of motion.  (Which is to say,  you could correct your timing
to that level.)  In theory,  it's better than that,  but I don't really have
a way to test it except by matching it to observations. The best observations
thus far have led to timing and positions consistent to that level.

<p> The satellites have positions known to within a few centimeters.  Of
course,  that's the position of the antenna;  if the center of light
measured on a CCD is,  say,  a meter away,  that would lead to about half
a millisecond of error (the satellites move at about 2000 meters a
second).  We may be at that level of accuracy,  but I can't really say for
sure. </p>

<b> Source code</b> (C/C++) is available at GitHub. </a>

<p> <a name="gnss"> <b> 'GNSS' </b> (Global Navigation Satellite System) </a>
includes GPS,  GLONASS,  Galileo,
QZSS,  and BeiDou satellites.  You can get precise positions for GPS and GLONASS
for dates starting about a day ago and running a few days into the future (i.e.,
predictions are available).  For Galileo,  QZSS,  and BeiDou,  this is
sadly not the case.  You get approximate positions for finding them,  but
the precise positions needed to really check your timing lag by a few days. </p>

<p> I realize this is an annoyance:  you can image the objects,  but then
have to wait a few days to actually check your timing.  The problem is that
very precise positions (centimeter-level accuracy) are provided in the
<a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/orbits/SP3_format.html"> SP3 format </a>
for all GNSS satellites for those "past" dates.  But for the
near future and last day or so,  SP3 data exists only for GPS and GLONASS. </p>

<p> Positions for the remaining satellites are computed using
<a href="tle_info.htm"> Two-Line Elements (TLEs)</a>.  Those are good enough
to find the object,  but not good enough to really measure timing accurately. </p>

<h2> <a name="ack"> Acknowledgments </a> </h2>

<p> My thanks go to Jaime Nomen and Noelia S&aacute;nchez Ortiz for their
thoughts on using navigation satellites for timing astrometry,  and for
providing <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/pluto/mpecs/navst43.htm">
some example astrometry for testing that I was getting the right answers.
</a> </p>

<h2> <a name="changes"> Change log </a> </h2>

<p> (2018 Jan 1) Galileo,  BeiDou,  and JXSS navsats are now also listed,
along with the GPS and GLONASS satellites,  even for "current" times.
My hope is that this will provide alternative,  possibly brighter targets.
Be warned,  though,  that there's a slight element of inconvenience to them.
I can tell you where to look for these objects,  with an accuracy of an
arcminute or so.  But it takes a few days before really precise positions
are available for them.  Basically,  you can look here,  find out where
to get these satellites,  and then check back in a few days to learn where
they "really" were. </p>

<p> (2018 Jan 1) Also,  if the step size is in decimal minutes or days,
the output ephems are labelled in decimal minutes or days. </p>
