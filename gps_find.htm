<p> <a href="https://projectpluto.com/update8d.htm#time_entry"> Click here for a full list of possible
time formats that can be used. </a>  Feel free to experiment,  but getting
<i>too</i> clever is not advised.  I recommend a four-digit year,  named month,
and day followed by HH:MM:SS or decimal days (the first two examples shown
above),  leaving no ambiguity in your input. </p>

<p> <b> Time span: </b> Ephemerides are available from 1992 June 20 to four or
five days from now.  <i>Note</i> that unfortunately,  ephemerides for Galileo,
QZSS,  and BeiDou only run up to about a day ago;  from that point on,  all
we've got are ephems for GPS and GLONASS.  I'm working on this. </p>

<p> <b> Satellite IDs </b> with 'G' followed by two digits are GPS satellites.  Those
with 'R' followed by two digits are (Russian) GLONASS satellites.  'E'
is for the (European) Galileo satellites,  'J' for the (Japanese) QZSS,
and 'C' the (Chinese) BeiDou satellites. </p>

<p> <a name="mpc_code"> <b> MPC observatory code: </b> </a> This should be a
three-character code from
<a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/ObsCodesF.html">
the MPC's list of observatory codes. </a>  If you don't have such a code,
send me your latitude,  longitude,  and altitude (see contact details at
bottom) and I'll add a code for you.  Or you can use the next line to
enter your latitude,  longitude,  and altitude. </p>

<p> <a name='relocate'> <b> Lat/lon/altitude location: </b> </a> Instead of
specifying your location with an MPC code (see previous paragraph),  you
can enter a latitude,  longitude,  and altitude here.  These are examples
of valid locations : </p>

<p><pre>
w69.93, n44.02, 120m
N44 1 12, w 69 55 48, 300ft
44 1.2 N, W69 55.8 W, 120m
</pre> </p>

<p> As you can see,  the format is somewhat flexible.  The lat/lon can be
reversed,  and they can be in decimal degrees,  or degrees/minutes,  or
degrees/minutes/seconds.  And the altitude can be in feet or meters.
You do have to specify compass signs (N or S for latitude,  E or W for
longitude). These can be before or after the lat or lon.</p>

<p> The output will show the extracted lat/lon/alt position,  and may show
a location (such as 'US/Maine' for the above).  It will also show a link
to a Google map of that location.  I recommend using this to make sure
you're really at the right location. </p>


<p> <b> Satellite magnitudes</b>:  Jaime Nomen told me the magnitudes for GPS
satellites range from 10 to 14,  depending in part on the phase angle.  (I'm
hoping the GLONASS satellites are brighter,  but haven't heard of any
observations yet.)  By default,  the satellites are ordered by elongation;
I'd suggest getting satellites with high elongation that aren't marked 'Sha'
(in the earth's shadow).

<p> Jaime recommends getting images of multiple satellites at multiple times,
 to help detect random timing errors.

<p> <b> Accuracy</b> appears to be at least down to 0.2 arcsecond,  or about
10 milliseconds of motion.  (Which is to say,  you could correct your timing
to that level.)  In theory,  it's better than that,  but I don't really have
a way to test it except by matching it to observations. The best observations
thus far have led to timing and positions consistent to that level.

<p> The satellites have positions known to within a few centimeters.  Of
course,  that's the position of the antenna;  if the center of light
measured on a CCD is,  say,  a meter away,  that would lead to about half
a millisecond of error (the satellites move at about 2000 meters a
second).  We may be at that level of accuracy,  but I can't really say for
sure. </p>

<h2> <a name='gnss'> 'GNSS' definition </a> </h2>

<p> The terms 'GNSS' (Global Navigation Satellite System)
includes GPS,  GLONASS,  Galileo, QZSS,  and BeiDou satellites.
(It also includes the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Regional_Navigation_Satellite_System'>
Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)</a>,  but we
don't have positions for those.)  These are also generically
referred to as 'navigation satellites' or 'navsats'.  They are
sometimes called 'GPS',  but that term really ought to be used
to refer specifically to the U.S. navigation satellites.

<h2> <a name='use_tles'> Using TLEs (Two-Line Elements) </a> </h2>

<p> We have precise positions (within centimeters) for 'right now',  and a few days
into the future,  for the GPS,  GLONASS,  and Galileo constellations.
You can make plans to observe those objects,  get data for them,  and
immediately check your data against the precise values. </p>

<p> For QZSS and BeiDou,  we only get that precision a few
days after the fact.  We can give you a 'pretty good' idea of where they
are,  though,  using
<a href="tle_info.htm"> Two-Line Elements (TLEs)</a> that are published
for all navigation satellites.  The TLE-based positions are good to
a few kilometers,  enough to let you find the objects with a telescope,
but not really good enough to check your timing.  But after a few days,
full-precision positions good to centimeters will be posted for all
navsats,  and you can check your timing then. </p>

<p> Almost always,  there are plenty of GPS,  GLONASS,  and Galileo objects
available,  and those will be the only one listed for 'right now' and the
next few days.  If you tick the 'Show TLE-based objects' box above,  you'll
get a <i>lot</i> more satellites that can be observed... but you won't
be able to actually process your observations against precise positions
until a few days after you've made them.  This is annoying enough that by
default,  that box is left unticked.  (And given how many objects are in
the first three groups,  I can't really come up with a good reason
to tick it.) </p>

<h2> <a name="ack"> Acknowledgments </a> </h2>

<p> My thanks go to Jaime Nomen and Noelia S&aacute;nchez Ortiz for their
thoughts on using navigation satellites for timing astrometry,  and for
providing <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/pluto/mpecs/navst43.htm">
some example astrometry for testing that I was getting the right answers; </a>
and to Dave Tholen for doing some really amazing tests of the sort
that require a 2.2-m telescope,  the extreme conditions on Mauna Kea,
and really knowing how to get the last bit of precision out of astrometry.
</p>

<h2> <a name="changes"> Change log </a> </h2>

<p> (2018 Jan 1) Galileo,  BeiDou,  and JXSS navsats are now also listed,
along with the GPS and GLONASS satellites,  even for "current" times.
My hope is that this will provide alternative,  possibly brighter targets.
Be warned,  though,  that there's a slight element of inconvenience to them.
I can tell you where to look for these objects,  with an accuracy of an
arcminute or so.  But it takes a few days before really precise positions
are available for them.  Basically,  you can look here,  find out where
to get these satellites,  and then check back in a few days to learn where
they "really" were. </p>
