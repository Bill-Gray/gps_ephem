<h1> Calibrating timing of astronomical images using navigation satellites </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p> Getting the timing right in astronomical imaging is both
important and surprisingly difficult to do.  The common tendency seems
to be to say that you've corrected the time on your computer using
GPS signals or NTP,  and that therefore,  the time written out in
your image files must be that of the midpoint of the exposure.

<p> Sadly,  while your computer may indeed be synched to have
almost exactly the right time,  the time in your images can still
be considerably off.  I've seen cases where the times were for the
beginning of the exposure.  Or the end of exposure.  Or,  for reasons
that passeth all understanding,  one exposure duration too early.
(Probably the camera returned a signal when it started the exposure,
which the software took to mean the end of the exposure?)  Or the
time the image was written out to the hard disk.

<p> About the only way to really verify that the image times are
correct is to check them against a known object.  Global Navigation
Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide satellites that move about 40 arcseconds
per second (some a bit faster or slower).  If you image one and can
measure the endpoints of its trail to within (say) two arcseconds,
you've basically fixed the time at which the image was taken to within
1/20 second.

<p> Positions are available for GNSS satellites from five systems:
GPS (United States),  GLONASS (Soviet Union/Russia),  Galileo (Europe),
BeiDou (China),  and QZSS (Japan).  The positions should be good to
within centimeters,  more than good enough for our purposes.

<p> The basic procedure is to <a href="gps_find.htm"> get a list of
GNSS satellites visible at your location for a given time.</a>  You
can then pick out one or more to observe;  I recommend choosing those
at high elongations from the sun,  but not actually in the earth's
shadow.  The brightness of these satellites tends to drop quickly
when they're far from opposition.

<p> Then,  for each satellite you wish to observe,  you can
<a href="gps_eph.htm"> create ephemerides for a particular satellite</a>
and go out and observe it.  The difference between where you measure
its position and the ephemeris position gives you your timing offset.

<p> I recommend observing multiple satellites (to reduce the chances
for error) and to use different exposure durations.  This last point
is significant.  You could observe lots of satellites with,  say,  a
ten-second exposure,  and determine that your timing was off by
seven seconds,  and adjust your timing accordingly.

<p> What you might fail to notice in this case is that a 20-second
duration would be off by twelve seconds,  if the time reported was
that of the end of the exposure,  plus two seconds while the image
was downloaded from the camera.

<p> Once you've gotten astrometry,  you can <a href="gps_ast.htm">
upload your astrometry and find out how far off you were. </a>  The
tool will figure out which object(s) you observed,  the timing
difference for each observation,  and how far "cross-track" you were
(that is,  the difference between your measured position and the
closest the object should have come to that position).  You'll
also get the average timing and cross-track residual errors,  and
their scatter (standard deviation). </p>

<h2> <a name="tles"> Ephemeris sources </a> </h2>

<p> <i>Usually</i>,  the tools on this site can just give you an
accurate position for the GNSS satellites,  and you can regard that
as the answer you'd get if your timing was good to within 1/100
second or so,  and possibly better (ten-millisecond accuracy has
been tested;  millisecond-level accuracy is expected,  but I haven't
figured out a way to test it yet.)

<p> Positions at that level of accuracy are
available a few days in advance for GPS and GLONASS satellites.
For Galileo,  BeiDou,  and QZSS satellites,  you only get that level
of accuracy a few days late.  These tools will give you positions
for such satellites in those cases,  usually good to within a few
arcminutes.  So you can go out,  observe a BeiDou or Galileo satellite,
then wait a few days for the precise ephemerides to become available.
Once you've got them,  you can use them to check how accurate your
timing was.

<p> I realize that this is somewhat annoying.  Unfortunately,  we
seem to be stuck with it.  I'm getting the "imprecise" positions
from <a href="tle_info.htm"> TLEs (Two-Line Elements)</a>.  Without
those,  we'd have no idea where to look in advance for Galileo,
BeiDou,  or QZSS objects.  We'd know exactly where they had been,
but not where to point our telescopes tonight.

<p> Fortunately,  though,  there are plenty of GPS and GLONASS
satellites.  You may find that limiting yourself only to those
constellations is not,  in practice,  all that limiting.

<h2> <a name="sites"> Low-precision site locations </a> </h2>

<p> The positions given for observatories are,  with few exceptions,
from <a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/ObsCodes.html">
a list of observatories maintained by the Minor Planet Center</a>.
(An <a href="https://projectpluto.com/mpc_stat.htm"> extended version
of the same list is available</a> that adds a few details and explanations.)
The MPC list provides,  at best,  a precision of about 6.4 meters in
altitude and latitude (10<sup>-6</sup> of the earth's radius).  In
some cases,  one or even two fewer digits are given.  When that
happens,  you get a warning message about loss of precision. </p>

<p> The degree to which you should worry about this varies.  At
least one user of these tools is investigating errors at the millisecond
level.  In one millisecond,  a GPS satellite moves about three meters.
If your observatory positions is chopped off to 64-meter precision,
you can still correct your timing to within about 40 milliseconds.

<p> You <i>may</i> find an 'observatory code' in my
<a href="https://github.com/Bill-Gray/find_orb/blob/master/rovers.txt">
errata to the MPC observatory list</a> that gives correct precision.
In particular,  Mauna Kea is not only given to low precision;  the
position is for one telescope,  probably the IRTF.  As described at
the above link,  one can instead use 'codes' such as Sub for Subaru,
Ke1 and Ke2 for the two Keck telescopes,  and so on.  Positions are
also given for scopes at Cerro Tololo,  Cerro Paranal,  Kitt Peak,
Haleakal&#x101;,  and La Silla that would be lumped into one position
by MPC. </p>

<p> Also,  you can <a href="#contact"> send me your latitude,  longitude,
and altitude</a> and I'll either correct the MPC's position or add
an entirely new "MPC code" (unofficial,  of course!) so you can get
correct data. </p>

<h2> <a name="to_do"> Remaining things to do </a> </h2>

<p> &bull;  I've written code to do precovery searches for GNSS
sats:  give it a list of where you took images over the years
("I got the following RA/dec rectangle at thus-and-such times"),
and it will tell you where and when you got satellites.

<p> The problem with this is that there are currently about 80 GNSS
satellites, or about one in every 500 square degrees of sky.  Go back
a few years,  and it's a lot less than that.  If you're a big
asteroid survey,  you'll still have plenty of opportunities to
spot-check your timing (i.e.,  you don't get checking on every image,
but enough to see night-to-night variations).  For smaller scale
observers, you'll just get a spot-check at larger intervals.

<p> One such check found <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/temp/neat.txt">
170 GNSS satellites found by the NEAT survey</a> between 1996 to 2002,
and I've run similar searches for three other telescopes.  But the
code is not particularly easy for anyone else to use at this point.
