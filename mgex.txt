   The organization of MGEX (merged GNSS) files is somewhat complicated.
Having gotten it somewhat straight in my head,  I'm entering it here for
future self-reference.

   The files are in directories of the form

ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/gps/products/mgex/wwww

   wherein wwww = GPS week.  SP3 files are then stored with names of
the form

xxxwwwwd.sp3.Z

   wherein xxx = 'com',  'gbm',  'gfm',  'wum',  'tum',  and some others.
The level of completeness (number of satellites included) is quite
variable,  and some sources provide satellites that others don't.  The
ideal situation,  from my standpoint,  would be a single file that
merges everything.  But we don't get that.

   Since we don't,  I've done some spot checks in an attempt to figure
out which three-letter prefix ought to be used in what case.

   Files start in week 1689.  (There are a few files before that,
actually,  but it's spotty coverage at best.)  At this point,  'com'
is the only game in town,  providing data for 60 satellites.

   'com' files retained their lead up until about week 1777,  when
'wum' (University of Wuhan) files took over.

   'wum' maintained that lead up to week 1950 or so,  whereupon 'gbm'
files took the lead (but it's about a one-satellite difference).

   'gbm' files are good to GPS 20376 = 2019 Jan 26.  For GPS 20380
= 2019 Jan 27,  the next such file is renamed to

GFZ0MGXRAP_20190270000_01D_05M_ORB.SP3.gz

   (same directory structure and it's in the week 2038 directory;
note that the filename is given in YYYYDDD,  year-and-day-of-year.)
I think this is just a renaming,  i.e.,  same basic data.
